        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an education major. Although I am not sure on what I want to do with my major, I am heading in the direction of becoming a teacher. I have absolutely no experience in teaching, however I have been a tutor for kids that are younger than me. I taught them all kinds of subjects such as math, science, english, history, and art. I have taken care of multiple children since I was a middle child. I have years of experience with dealing with people younger and older than me. Effectivecommunication. Organization and Prioritization. Bilingual in Spanish and English. Calm and Patient Demeanor .Friendly and outgoing.I worked at target as a cashier.During July all the way too May.Supported the opening and closing of each shift demonstrating leadership and punctuality. Worked in a fast paced environment while also providing good customer service to the guests coming and leaving. Maintained a clean, organized inventory and curated displays of rotating items. Helped with customer needs while providing them with excellent customer service. I was also a Host at a restaurant called El torito in Orange California. I worked there during May to June. <br><br>

        So almost a year and the only reason why I quit was because They closed down. Greeted incoming guests and escorted them to the assigned dining area and presented menus. Adapted and worked under pressure in a fast paced environment averaging 200-300 guests per day. Responded appropriately to customer complaints, bringing major issues to the attention of manager on duty. Checked dining and serving areas to verify proper cleanliness and readiness for guests. I was also a camp counselor at a water park called, Wild rivers. I worked there all of . Interacted with more than one hundred kids a day while also managing to make bonds with all of the kids. Taught lifeguard and essential swimming skills to children from the ages of six to twelve .Supervised the kids for eight hours a day on the campgrounds and also in the water park. Developed my leadership skills while also exercising my teaching abilities.  My educational journey so far has felt very slow and yet somehow fast. The most significant part of my journey has been my transition into middle school. I had started to change physically and with this I felt as if my mental maturity somehow grew as well. My whole middle school experience was very messy to say the least because of this change. I was a decent student doing the bare minimum and never anything more. <br><br>

        I was much more occupied with my friends and whatever drama we had going on that week. I got into a fair amount of trouble and caused problems with my friends almost weekly. Because of me always getting into trouble, I had adopted the mindset of not taking too much consideration for my academics and thought school was solely a place to socialize. From this it resulted in me getting in trouble with my parents almost daily and caused them to push me to better my grades. They constantly told me I needed to do better or else I would face the consequences. My older sister being the golden child that she is, was praised relentlessly for her grades and achievements. Her love of reading and her love for English set the standard very high in my household and gave my parents very high expectations. Anything below an A was unacceptable and was not to be tolerated in the house. With these expectations being placed on me, I felt it was unachievable to ever be better or equal to my sister, causing me to never even attempt at getting good grades. I had no love for school, as my sister did, and felt I was inferior to her in every way. I had begun to feel as if I was always going to be considered the dumb sister and had no motivation to change that.Going into highschool, it was such a different experience from how I thought it was going to be. I had a whole new set of friends and somehow I had let my Mom convince me into taking advanced placement classes, which gave me a heavy workload. One thing I loved about high school was that it felt so much more liberating than middle school and I loved the change in environment I was in. Since I did not do so well in the years prior, I made it my goal to make the most out of my high school experience and do the best I could do.
